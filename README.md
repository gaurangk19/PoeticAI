Implemented a text generation model using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with LSTM layers to generate Shakespearean-style text, leveraging TensorFlow for model development and training.

Developed a data preprocessing pipeline to convert raw text into numerical representations, incorporating one-hot encoding and sequence-based sampling methodologies for optimal input preparation.

Applied advanced temperature-based sampling techniques to control text creativity and variability, showcasing the model's ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text outputs.
